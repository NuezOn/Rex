    Configuration Overview
</div>
<div class="content_section_text">
    <p>
        Ubuntu's Apache2 default configuration is different from the
        upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for
        interaction with Ubuntu tools. The configuration system is
        <b>fully documented in
            /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz</b>. Refer to this for the full
        documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be
        found by accessing the <a href="/manual">manual</a> if the <tt>apache2-doc</tt>
        package was installed on this server.
    </p>
    <p>
        The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Ubuntu systems is as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>/etc/apache2/
|-- apache2.conf
|       `--  ports.conf
|-- mods-enabled
|       |-- *.load
|       `-- *.conf
|-- conf-enabled
|       `-- *.conf
|-- sites-enabled
|       `-- *.conf
                  </pre>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <tt>apache2.conf</tt> is the main configuration
            file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration
            files when starting up the web server.
        </li>

        <li>
            <tt>ports.conf</tt> is always included from the
            main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for
            incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime.
        </li>

        <li>
            Configuration files in the <tt>mods-enabled/</tt>,
            <tt>conf-enabled/</tt> and <tt>sites-enabled/</tt> directories contain
            particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration
            fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively.
        </li>

        <li>
            They are activated by symlinking available
            configuration files from their respective
            *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed
            by using our helpers
            <tt>
                a2enmod,
                a2dismod,
            </tt>
            <tt>
                a2ensite,
                a2dissite,
            </tt>
            and
            <tt>
                a2enconf,
                a2disconf
            </tt>. See their respective man pages for detailed information.
        </li>

        <li>
            The binary is called apache2 and is managed using systemd, so to
            start/stop the service use <tt>systemctl start apache2</tt> and
            <tt>systemctl stop apache2</tt>, and use <tt>systemctl status apache2</tt>
            and <tt>journalctl -u apache2</tt> to check status. <tt>system</tt>
            and <tt>apache2ctl</tt> can also be used for service management if
            desired.
            <b>Calling <tt>/usr/bin/apache2</tt> directly will not work</b> with the
            default configuration.
        </li>
