        By default, Ubuntu does not allow access through the web browser to
        <em>any</em> file outside of those located in <tt>/var/www</tt>,
        <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_userdir.html" rel="nofollow">public_html</a>
        directories (when enabled) and <tt>/usr/share</tt> (for web
        applications). If your site is using a web document root
        located elsewhere (such as in <tt>/srv</tt>) you may need to whitelist your
        document root directory in <tt>/etc/apache2/apache2.conf</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The default Ubuntu document root is <tt>/var/www/html</tt>. You
        can make your own virtual hosts under /var/www.
